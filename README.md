## Abstract
Rapid and comprehensive data sharing is vital to the transparency and actionability of wildlife infectious disease surveillance and research.
Unfortunately, most best practices for publicly sharing these data are focused on pathogen determination and genetic sequence data. 
Other facets of wildlife disease data – particularly negative results – are often withheld or, at best, summarized in a descriptive table with limited metadata. 
Here, we provide a minimum data and metadata reporting standard for wildlife disease studies. 
Our data standard identifies a set of 41 data fields (9 required) and 24 metadata (7 required) fields sufficient to standardize and document a dataset consisting of records disaggregated to the finest possible spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scale. 

## Data Validation Package

For convenience, we have developed the [wddsWizard](https://viralemergence.github.io/wddsWizard) R package for data validation. 

The wddsWizard package contains [searchable documentation for terms](https://viralemergence.github.io/wddsWizard/articles/schema_overview.html#terms). 

Data can also be validated against the JSON schema using a validation engine (e.g. [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/guide/getting-started.html)).
